# Friendly Neighbor

Friendly Neighbor is a network server that responds to ARP and NDP requests on behalf of other LAN devices. Think of it as applying a set of static IP-to-MAC address mappings for all devices on your LAN.

Its main use-case is enabling network packets to be sent to sleeping machines so that they can be woken up on demand using wake-on-unicast. [This blog post](https://dgross.ca/blog/linux-home-server-auto-sleep/) explains the technique in detail.

## Features
* Super lightweight and performant, built with Zig
* Built with libpcap for efficient, low-overhead packet filtering
* Compiled statically as a single binary without dependencies
* Supports different CPU architectures, including x86 and Raspberry Pi (ARM)
* Supports any flavor of Linux
* Can respond on behalf of multiple machines at once
* IPv4 and IPv6 support

## Prerequisites
* Linux (any distro, kernel version 2.0+)
* Wired Ethernet network interface

## Installation
Coming soon...
